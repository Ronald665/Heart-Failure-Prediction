## 📄 Heart Disease Prediction

### 🌍 Background
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally, claiming an estimated 17.9 million lives annually, which accounts for approximately 31% of all deaths worldwide.
Among these, 4 out of 5 CVD-related deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, with one-third occurring prematurely in individuals under 70 years old.

Heart failure is often the result of unmanaged cardiovascular disease. Therefore, early detection is critical — especially for individuals with known risk factors such as:

1) Hypertension

2) Diabetes

3) Hyperlipidaemia

4) Existing CVD history

In this context, machine learning models can provide a powerful, cost effective, and scalable tool for early risk prediction and intervention.

### 📊 Dataset Overview:
This dataset contains 11 features describing clinical attributes of patients. The goal is to predict the presence of heart disease using these features.

Target Variable: HeartDisease

1: Presence of heart disease

0: No heart disease (normal)

### 🧬 Feature Descriptions
Feature Name	Description
1) Age of the patient (in years)
2) Biological sex of the patient:
• M: Male
• F: Female
3) ChestPainType: Type of chest pain experienced:
• TA: Typical Angina
• ATA: Atypical Angina
• NAP: Non Anginal Pain
• ASY: Asymptomatic
4) RestingBP: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)
5) Cholesterol:	Serum cholesterol level (in mg/dl)
6) FastingBS: Fasting blood sugar:
• 1: FBS > 120 mg/dl
• 0: FBS ≤ 120 mg/dl
7) RestingECG: Resting electrocardiogram results:
• Normal
• ST: ST-T wave abnormality
• LVH: Left ventricular hypertrophy
8) MaxHR: Maximum heart rate achieved
9) ExerciseAngina: Exercise induced angina:
• Y: Yes
• N: No
10) Oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11) ST_Slope: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment:
• Up: Upsloping
• Flat: Flat
• Down: Downsloping

### 🧠 Objective:
Develop and evaluate a machine learning model to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on their medical profile, enabling early risk assessment and potential intervention.
